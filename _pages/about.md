My name is Ismail Olaniyi, and I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. My affinity for geospatial intelligence inspired me to choose a career path in Geomatics. I obtained my diploma from the Federal School of Surveying, Oyo, and my bachelorâ€™s degree from the University of Lagos, Nigeria, both in Surveying and Geoinformatics. I am interested in applying geospatial technologies to solve real-world problems in fields such as precision agriculture and disaster mitigation. I am a certified UAS pilot and a Land Surveyor in training in the State of Indiana. Additionally, I have garnered relevant work experience and training within the geospatial industry through internships and volunteering projects. My roles have included Land Surveyor, Mining Surveyor, and Geospatial Data Analyst at a leading geospatial intelligence firm in Nigeria. I have been involved in projects such as processing and analyzing field data for Power Distribution Agencies, Underground Utility Mapping, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mapping, and other exciting projects aimed at sustainable development and growth. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Engr/Academics/Graduate/testimonials/students/ismail-olaniyi), working on developing a data pipeline between UASHub and the T3 Breedbase database. This pipeline will facilitate the efficient transfer of plot information from T3 and the subsequent return of processed phenotypic data to the T3 database. My work is under the supervision of Dr. Jinha Jung at the [Geospatial Data Science Laboratory](https://gdslab.org/) and is in collaboration with the Texas A&M team. My research focuses on developing yield estimation models using multi-temporal UAS datasets. My long-term goal is to contribute to scientific research by developing geospatial tools to help make more informed decisions in various fields, such as precision agriculture, disaster mitigation, etc.

Part of my role at the University is being a **Teaching Assistant** for the Principles and Practice of Geomatics (CE 203), a mandatory course for undergraduates in the Civil Engineering program at the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University. Beyond my academics, I enjoyed watching soccer games and my favotite team is [Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/), mentoring young school leavers and volunteering within my local community and beyond.
